### 🔍 What Is a Blox Fruits Script?

A **Blox Fruits script** is a set of Lua instructions used with a Roblox executor. Once launched, it gives players enhanced control over the game, unlocking custom GUI panels and automation tools that go far beyond the default experience.

Scripts can automate actions like defeating enemies, collecting items, traveling between islands, leveling up skills, and more. Many also come with custom features like player ESP, fruit spawners, and quest chains.

### 💡 Key Features of the Best Blox Fruits Scripts

Let’s explore the most powerful tools these scripts provide and how they help players climb to the top faster:

---

#### ⚔️ Auto Farm System
The auto farm tool is one of the most-used features in any Blox Fruits script. It allows players to:

- Automatically defeat NPCs based on your current level or quest  
- Farm bosses and mini-bosses repeatedly  
- Train specific weapons, fruits, or skills  
- Select targets by zone or enemy type  
- Enable kill-aura or smart attack modes  

This turns long grinding sessions into short, efficient runs.

#### 🍇 Fruit ESP and Sniper
Finding devil fruits is a core part of the game — but waiting around for random spawns can be time-consuming. Scripts solve this with:

- **Fruit ESP** – Highlights all fruits through walls and terrain  
- **Fruit Sniper** – Automatically teleports to fruit when it spawns  
- **Fruit Filter** – Detect specific rare types like Dragon or Dough  
- **Spawn Notifier** – Alerts you the second a fruit appears  

With these tools, you’ll always be first to the fruit drop.

#### 🚀 Teleport System
Instant movement across the map saves time and makes farming way more efficient. Features include:

- Teleport to any island or sea instantly  
- Auto teleport to bosses, enemies, or quests  
- Access chests, hidden areas, or event zones  
- Create and save custom teleport routes  

This is especially useful when navigating between the First, Second, and Third Seas.

#### 🎯 Auto Mastery Training
Leveling up fruits, swords, and guns can take hours — unless you're using mastery tools that:

- Automatically attack enemies until mastery is maxed  
- Switch to new weapons as needed  
- Focus on optimal HP enemies for fast leveling  
- Work safely in private or low-population servers  

---

#### 🧠 Auto Quest Handler
Quest chains are the backbone of leveling. Scripts can:

- Auto-accept the most suitable quest for your level  
- Complete the quest using auto attack features  
- Automatically progress through storyline and level tiers  
- Repeat quests without needing manual clicks  

It’s one of the best tools for fast, consistent XP gain.

#### 👁️ Player & Item ESP
ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) overlays extra information on your screen, helping you:

- See other players' locations across the map  
- Spot NPCs, chests, and special items  
- Track enemy movement during PvP or boss fights  
- Gain visibility through terrain and structures  

This boosts your awareness in every situation.
